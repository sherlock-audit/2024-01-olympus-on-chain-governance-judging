# GovernorBravoDelegate::propose() function is incorrectly updating the state variables for policy contracts

## Summary
GovernorBravoDelegate::propose() function looks for any high risk proposals by calling **_isHighRiskProposal()** function to ensure qualified voting is there to support such proposals. In the process of evaluating the high risk proposals, the delegate contract makes call to **configureDependencies() on policy contract** to get the list of dependencies.

But, **configureDependencies()** is **not a view only function** to return list of dependencies, but instead it is a function that **configures the state variables for the policies,** actually intended to be called by kernel for sync updates, if any changes happen in the setup at kernel level.

This is an **incorrect usage** of **configureDependencies()** function to read dependencies and could impact the protocol negatively.

## Vulnerability Detail
The call to _isHighRiskProposal() to decide whether there is any upgrade on the policy contract incorrectly updates the configuration of the policy contracts.

Example contracts that updates the state variables are

    1) appraiser   
    2) operator
    3) BunniManager   


## Impact
Unexpected change in behavior of the protocol.

call to configureDependencies() on policy, some of those policies updates state variables on the policy contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Provision a separate function in policies to return dependencies so that this conflict does not arise.
