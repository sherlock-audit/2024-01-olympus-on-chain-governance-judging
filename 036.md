# GovernorBravoDelegateStorage - Insecure Upgradeability Pattern

## Summary
The **GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2** contract, as part of an upgradeable contract pattern, may be vulnerable to insecure upgradeability due to the lack of safeguards around the upgrade process, potentially leading to unauthorized contract upgrades or downgrade attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract relies on the **implementation** variable to delegate calls to the implementation contract. However, without stringent access controls and security checks, the upgrade process is susceptible to unauthorized changes, allowing attackers to alter the contract's logic or downgrade it to a less secure version.
## Impact
If an attacker gains control over the upgrade process, they could divert the delegate calls to a malicious implementation, leading to loss of funds, corruption of the governance process, or complete takeover of the contract's functionality.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a secure upgrade process with robust access control, **timelocks**, and potentially multi-signature requirements for critical actions like contract upgrades. Consider using established frameworks for upgradeable contracts, such as **OpenZeppelin's** **TransparentUpgradeableProxy** and **ProxyAdmin**, to manage upgrades securely.

Ensure that only trusted addresses can propose and execute upgrades. Include mechanisms to propose, review, and approve upgrades before execution, providing transparency and security.

Include a timelock in the upgrade process to give stakeholders enough time to react to proposed changes. This delay allows for thorough review and potential intervention if the proposed upgrade is malicious or undesirable.

Code Snippet for Fix:

```solidity
uint256 public constant UPGRADE_DELAY = 2 days;
uint256 public upgradeTimelock;
address public pendingImplementation;

// Propose a new implementation, initiating the timelock period
function proposeUpgrade(address implementation_) public {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can propose upgrade");
    require(implementation_ != address(0), "Invalid implementation address");
    require(upgradeTimelock == 0, "Upgrade already proposed");
    
    pendingImplementation = implementation_;
    upgradeTimelock = block.timestamp + UPGRADE_DELAY;
    emit UpgradeProposed(implementation_);
}

// Execute the upgrade after the timelock period has passed
function executeUpgrade() public {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can execute upgrade");
    require(block.timestamp >= upgradeTimelock, "Timelock has not expired yet");
    require(pendingImplementation != address(0), "No pending upgrade");

    address oldImplementation = implementation;
    implementation = pendingImplementation;
    pendingImplementation = address(0);
    upgradeTimelock = 0;
    emit NewImplementation(oldImplementation, implementation);
}

```
By leveraging a secure upgrade pattern with adequate access control and a transparent review process, the contract can prevent unauthorized upgrades and ensure that any change to the contract's logic is conducted securely, transparently, and with community consensus.
