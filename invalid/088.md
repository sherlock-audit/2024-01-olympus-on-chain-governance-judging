# `GovernorBravoDelegate::cancel` wrongfully allows the cancelation of whitelisted proposers due a logic error

## Summary

`GovernorBravoDelegate::cancel` wrongfully allows the cancelation of whitelisted proposers due a logic error

## Vulnerability Detail

When a proposal is being canceled, whitelisted proposers aren't supposed to be cancelled for falling below proposal threshold:

```solidity
        if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) {
            // Whitelisted proposers can't be canceled for falling below proposal threshold
```

There is however a logic error which allows them to be cancelled by anyone if they fall below the threshold:

```solidity
            if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer)) {
                if (
                    (gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                        proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
```

The condition:

```solidity
(gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >= proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
```

means that if the proposal threshold hasn't been met by a whitelisted proposer, there will be no revert and the proposal will proceed to cancelation.

## Impact

A malicious attacker can cancel whitelisted proposals at will if they fall below the proposal threshold.

## Recommendation

The condition should instead be:

```solidity
 if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer && msg.sender != whitelistGuardian) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
```
