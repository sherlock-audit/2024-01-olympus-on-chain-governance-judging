# Inadequate Handling of Proposal Execution Errors

## Summary
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract's execute function allows for the execution of queued proposals. However, there is inadequate error handling for individual action executions within a proposal. This could lead to partial execution of proposals if one of the actions fails.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the execute function, proposals are executed by iterating through each action and calling the corresponding function on the target contract. If an action fails due to an error in the target contract or invalid calldata, the entire transaction is reverted, potentially preventing the execution of subsequent actions in the proposal.
## Impact
A failure in executing one action of a proposal can lead to the entire proposal not being executed, even if other actions in the proposal are valid and critical for the governance process. This could delay important governance actions and require the proposal to be resubmitted and voted on again, consuming additional time and resources.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement robust error handling for the execution of individual actions within a proposal. Consider the following approaches:

**Try-Catch for Individual Actions**: Wrap each action execution in a **try-catch block** to handle errors gracefully. Log the success or failure of each action without reverting the entire transaction.

**Flagging of Failed Actions**: Introduce a mechanism to flag actions that failed during execution, allowing governance participants to review and address these failures without impacting the execution of other actions in the proposal.

Here's how you might implement try-catch for individual actions:

```solidity
function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
        try timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
            proposal.targets[i],
            proposal.values[i],
            proposal.signatures[i],
            proposal.calldatas[i],
            proposal.eta
        ) {
            emit ActionExecuted(proposalId, i, true);
        } catch {
            emit ActionExecuted(proposalId, i, false);
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
In this modification, each action execution is wrapped in a **try-catch block**. The success or failure of each action is emitted as an event (**ActionExecuted**). This allows for the execution of all actions in the proposal, even if some actions fail, and provides transparency about the execution status of each action.
