# Legitimate Voting Power Increase being penalized by current business logic

## Summary
The current business logic in the `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract penalizes legitimate increases in voting power for voters who acquire more tokens after the start of a proposal. This is due to the calculation taking the minimum of the voting power at the proposal's start and the current voting power.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `castVoteInternal` function of the `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract, the voting power of a voter is determined by comparing the voting power at the start of the proposal (`originalVotes`) with the current voting power (`currentVotes`) using the following code:

```solidity
uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;
```

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that voters who legitimately acquire more tokens after the proposal's start are not fully recognized for their increased voting power. If their current voting power is higher than their original voting power at the start of the proposal, they are restricted to using the original voting power. This approach can disenfranchise voters and create an unfair sentiment among users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue and ensure that legitimate increases in voting power are recognized, it is recommended to modify the logic in the `castVoteInternal` function to consider only the voting power at the start of the proposal (`originalVotes`). The check for the current voting power (`currentVotes`) should be removed. Here's the recommended modification:

```solidity
uint256 votes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
```

This change ensures that voters who increase their stake after a proposal starts are not disenfranchised and simplifies the voting power calculation.
