# Potential Reentrancy Vulnerabilities in Proposal Execution

## Summary
The **GovernorBravoDelegate** contract's **execute** function allows for the execution of queued proposals, which can call arbitrary external contracts and functions. However, there is a potential risk of reentrancy attacks if the called external contracts interact back with the governance contract in an unexpected way.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **execute** function iterates through the actions of a proposal and executes them. If any of these actions include calls to untrusted external contracts, and those contracts make reentrant calls back to the governance contract, it could lead to issues where the governance contract's state is manipulated unexpectedly.
## Impact
Reentrancy attacks can lead to a variety of issues, including unexpected changes in the state of the contract, manipulation of ongoing proposals, or extraction of funds or assets managed by the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement reentrancy protection for the execute function to prevent potential attacks. This could involve using the reentrancy guard modifier from **OpenZeppelin's** contracts or a custom solution to ensure that no external calls can reenter the governance contract during the execution of a proposal. Here's how you might implement a reentrancy guard using **OpenZeppelin's** **ReentrancyGuard**:

Import the **ReentrancyGuard** contract from **OpenZeppelin** and inherit it in the **GovernorBravoDelegate** contract.

Use the **nonReentrant** modifier on the execute function to prevent reentrancy.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract GovernorBravoDelegate is GovernorBravoDelegateStorageV2, IGovernorBravoEventsAndErrors, ReentrancyGuard {
    ...
    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable nonReentrant {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                proposal.eta
            );
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
By using the **nonReentrant** modifier from **OpenZeppelin's** **ReentrancyGuard**, you can protect the execute function from reentrancy attacks, ensuring that the state of the governance contract remains consistent and secure throughout the execution of proposals.
