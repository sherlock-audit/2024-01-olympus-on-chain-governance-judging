# Insufficient Checks on Proposal Signature and Calldata Formats

## Summary
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract does not perform thorough validation on the function signatures and calldata provided in proposals, potentially allowing malformed or dangerous calls to be included in proposals.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a new proposal is created, the propose function accepts arrays of target addresses, ETH values, function signatures, and calldata. However, the validation on these inputs, particularly the function signatures and calldata, is minimal. This could lead to scenarios where proposals include calls to functions that are not intended to be governed or that could cause unintended interactions with target contracts.
## Impact
Malformed or unintended function calls in proposals could lead to unexpected behavior when executed, potentially causing security risks, loss of funds, or other critical issues in the governed protocol or target contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the validation of function signatures and calldata in the propose function. Consider implementing the following:

Signature Format Validation: Ensure that function signatures are well-formed and match the expected pattern for Solidity function signatures. This could involve regex checks or other string validation methods.

Calldata Content Validation: Where possible, parse and validate the contents of calldata to ensure they adhere to expected formats, value ranges, or other constraints specific to the functions being called.

Here's a conceptual code snippet illustrating how you might implement basic validation for function signatures:

```solidity
function propose(...) public returns (uint256) {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; i++) {
        require(_isValidSignature(signatures[i]), "GovernorBravoDelegate: Invalid function signature");
        require(_isValidCalldata(calldatas[i]), "GovernorBravoDelegate: Invalid calldata");
        _queueOrRevertInternal(
            targets[i],
            values[i],
            signatures[i],
            calldatas[i],
            eta
        );
    }
    ...
}

function _isValidSignature(string memory signature) private pure returns (bool) {
    // Implement signature format checks
    ...
}

function _isValidCalldata(bytes memory calldata) private pure returns (bool) {
    // Implement calldata content checks
    ...
}
```
In this modification, **_isValidSignature** and **_isValidCalldata** are hypothetical functions that perform validation on the function signatures and calldata, respectively. Implementing thorough and context-specific validation logic in these functions can significantly reduce the risk of including malformed or unintended function calls in proposals.
