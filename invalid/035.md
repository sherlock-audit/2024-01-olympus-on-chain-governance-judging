# Inadequate Whitelist and Veto Guardian Controls

## Summary
The contract introduces **whitelistGuardian** and **vetoGuardian** roles for managing whitelist expirations and vetoing proposals. However, the implementation lacks sufficient controls and transparency, leading to potential risks in governance processes.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows for addresses to be whitelisted, potentially bypassing certain governance restrictions. Additionally, the veto power enables unilateral control over proposals. However, the contract does not implement transparent or restrictive mechanisms to manage these powers.
## Impact
Malicious actors or compromised accounts with **whitelistGuardian** or **vetoGuardian** roles can subvert governance processes, leading to unauthorized actions, trust issues among participants, and potential exploitation of the governed system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement rigorous access controls and transparency mechanisms for the whitelistGuardian and vetoGuardian roles:

1. **Multi-Signature Requirement:** Require multiple signatures for critical actions related to these roles to distribute trust and reduce the risk of unilateral decisions.
2. **Timelock Mechanism:** Introduce a timelock for significant actions, allowing stakeholders to review and potentially contest changes before they take effect.
3. **Event Logging:** Emit events for every significant action, such as adding/removing whitelisted addresses or invoking veto power, to ensure transparency and traceability.
4. **Role Management**: Provide a secure process for appointing or revoking these powerful roles, ideally through a multi-step, community-driven governance process.

Code Snippet for Fix:
Implement event logging and role management:

```solidity
// Event logging for critical role actions
event WhitelistGuardianUpdated(address indexed previousGuardian, address indexed newGuardian);
event VetoGuardianUpdated(address indexed previousGuardian, address indexed newGuardian);
event AddressWhitelisted(address indexed account, uint256 expiration);
event AddressRemovedFromWhitelist(address indexed account);

// Secure role management
function updateWhitelistGuardian(address _newGuardian) external {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can update the whitelist guardian");
    emit WhitelistGuardianUpdated(whitelistGuardian, _newGuardian);
    whitelistGuardian = _newGuardian;
}

function updateVetoGuardian(address _newGuardian) external {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can update the veto guardian");
    emit VetoGuardianUpdated(vetoGuardian, _newGuardian);
    vetoGuardian = _newGuardian;
}

function whitelistAddress(address _account, uint256 _expiration) external {
    require(msg.sender == whitelistGuardian, "Only whitelist guardian can whitelist addresses");
    whitelistAccountExpirations[_account] = _expiration;
    emit AddressWhitelisted(_account, _expiration);
}

function removeWhitelistedAddress(address _account) external {
    require(msg.sender == whitelistGuardian, "Only whitelist guardian can remove addresses from whitelist");
    whitelistAccountExpirations[_account] = 0;
    emit AddressRemovedFromWhitelist(_account);
}
```
By integrating these recommendations, the governance system will benefit from enhanced security, transparency, and trustworthiness, safeguarding it against unauthorized manipulation.
