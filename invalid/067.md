# GovernorBravoDelegator can not receive ethers.

## Summary
[GovernorBravoDelegator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegator.sol) is a Proxy and points to [GovernorBravoDelegate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol) for implementation, and GovernorBravoDelegate does not have receive() function, hence GovernorBravoDelegator can not receive ethers.

## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a **receive()** function means that the contract cannot accept Ether transactions directly. This could be a critical issue, especially if users or other contracts attempt to send Ether to the **GovernorBravoDelegator**. The contract might be expecting Ether for certain functionalities, and the absence of a proper receive function may result disruption in contract operations.

For example, proposals that require Ethers in order to execute can not be executed because the contract will not have ethers in it. (Although the [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L255) function can receive ethers but it is callable by anyone and does not necessarily require the caller to send ethers to execute the proposal).

## Impact

**GovernorBravoDelegator** can not receive ethers and this issue may not allow some proposals that require ethers to execute.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
        if (state(proposalId) != ProposalState.Queued) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_NotQueued();

        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];

        // Check that proposer has not fallen below proposal threshold since proposal creation
        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can execute regardless of threshold
        if (
            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_BelowThreshold();

        proposal.executed = true;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                proposal.eta
            );
        }
        emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a receive() function inside the **GovernorBravoDelegate** so that **GovernorBravoDelegator** can receive Ethers.
```solidity    
receive() external payable {}
```
