# Incorrect Check in GovernorBravoDelegate.propose()

## Summary

The [propose()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L127) function in **GovernorBravoDelegate.sol** fails to allow proposal creation even when the proposer possesses sufficient votes equal to the required threshold, due to an incorrect conditional check.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the propose() function, the condition for checking if a proposal threshold is met is as follows:
```solidity
if (
    gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) <= getProposalThresholdVotes() &&
    !isWhitelisted(msg.sender)
) revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_ThresholdNotMet();

```
The issue arises when [getProposalThresholdVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L690) is equal to gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1). Logically, the condition should pass in such a scenario since the gohm.getPriorVotes() are equal to the required threshold. However, due to the use of the less than or equal to (<=) operator, the condition will evaluate to false, leading to a failed transaction.

Example: 
Suppose [getProposalThresholdVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L690) returns a value of 100, and gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) also returns 100. In this case, the condition should allow the proposal to proceed, but the current implementation would incorrectly reject it.

## Impact
Non-whitelisted users can not propose even after meeting the minimum threshold requirement.
## Code Snippet
Same as above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, the condition in the propose() function should be modified to use the less than (<) operator instead of less than or equal to (<=). The corrected condition would be:
```solidity
if (
    gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) < getProposalThresholdVotes() &&
    !isWhitelisted(msg.sender)
) revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_ThresholdNotMet();

```
