# The `msg.value` is not checked with the total values of the prposal's transactions in `execute`.

## Summary
When a proposal gets executed, the `msg.value` is not checked with the total values of the prposal's transactions. This may lead to potential fund loss:
1. A user can pay less ETH to execute a proposal if the contract has some ETH balance.
2. A user's extra ETH payment is not returned to him if he pays more ETH than needed.


## Vulnerability Detail
When a proposal gets executed, all of its transactions are executed one by one, and ETH are sended to the target addresses with the amount of `proposal.values[i]`. However, the `msg.value` send with `execute` is not checked with the total values sended to the target addresses. The impacts are:
1. If the contract has some ETH balance, user can pay less ETH than the total values of the transactions to successfully execute the proposal. This will drain the contract's ETH balance.
2. If a user pay more ETH than the total values of transactions, the extra ETH is not refunded to him.

255:    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
256:        if (state(proposalId) != ProposalState.Queued) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_NotQueued();
257:
258:        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
259:
260:        // Check that proposer has not fallen below proposal threshold since proposal creation
261:        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can execute regardless of threshold
262:        if (
263:            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
264:            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
265:        ) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_BelowThreshold();
266:
267:        proposal.executed = true;
268:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {

270:                proposal.targets[i],
271:                proposal.values[i],
272:                proposal.signatures[i],
273:                proposal.calldatas[i],
274:                proposal.eta
275:            );
276:        }
277:        emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
278:    }

## Impact
1. If the contract has some ETH balance, user can pay less ETH than the total values of the transactions to successfully execute the proposal. This will drain the contract's ETH balance.
2. If a user pay more ETH than the total values of transactions, the extra ETH is not refunded to him.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
In `execute`, check that `msg.value` is equal to the total values of the prposal's transactions, otherwise revert.
