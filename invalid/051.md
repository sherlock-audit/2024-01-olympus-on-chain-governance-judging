# Incorrect voting count

## Summary

The [`castVoteInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L433-L462) internal function incorrectly uses the current `block.number` for votes instead of retrieving votes from the previous block.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`castVoteInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L433-L462) internal function of the `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract is utilized by `castVote`, `castVoteWithReason`, and `castVoteBySig` to cast a vote for a given proposal. To accommodate the rebasing nature of `gOHM` tokens, the logic considers the user's votes at the time of proposal creation and at voting time, selecting the minimum. The issue arises from the use of the current `block.number` instead of `block.number - 1` for current votes. This opens the door to multiple scenarios of transferring votes between accounts to artificially inflate the number of votes.

## Impact

The attacker can artificially inflate the voting up to the value of votes at the time of the proposal start by transferring `gOHM` tokens between accounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use `block.number - 1` for the `currentVotes`:
```solidity
uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number - 1);
```
