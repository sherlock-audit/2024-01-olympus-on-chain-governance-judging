# Risk of Overflow in Proposal Threshold and Quorum Calculations

## Summary
Risk of Overflow in Proposal Threshold and Quorum Calculations

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract calculates the proposal threshold and quorum based on the total supply and percentage constants. However, there are no explicit checks for overflow in these calculations, potentially leading to incorrect computation if the total supply becomes exceedingly large.
## Impact
Incorrect computation of proposal thresholds and quorums can significantly impact the governance process, potentially making it impossible to reach quorum or propose new proposals.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the SafeMath library or similar safeguards to prevent overflow issues. Solidity 0.8.x offers built-in overflow checks, but explicit validation of the calculation results and constraints on the proposal threshold and quorum percentages can provide additional safety.
