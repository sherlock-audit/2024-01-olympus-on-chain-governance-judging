# Potential for Proposal Execution Delay due to Timelock Mismatch

## Summary
The **GovernorBravoDelegate** contract integrates with a **Timelock** contract for executing queued proposals. However, there is a potential mismatch between the proposal eta calculation in the governance contract and the actual execution time window defined in the **Timelock** contract, potentially leading to delays or failures in executing proposals.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract calculates an **eta** for each proposal based on the current block timestamp and the timelock delay. However, this calculation does not account for potential changes in the timelock delay or discrepancies between the calculated **eta** and the actual time window during which the timelock contract allows execution.
## Impact
If there is a mismatch between the proposal eta and the actual executable window in the timelock contract, it could lead to situations where proposals are either executed later than expected or unable to be executed due to missing the valid execution window. This could disrupt the governance process and delay critical governance actions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure tight synchronization between the GovernorBravoDelegate contract and the Timelock contract regarding the timing of proposal execution. Consider implementing the following:

- **Consistent Timing Parameters**: Align the eta calculation in the GovernorBravoDelegate contract with the execution window in the Timelock contract. This could involve directly fetching timing parameters from the Timelock contract when calculating eta.
- **Validation of Execution Window**: Implement checks in the execute function to ensure that the proposal is within the valid execution window as defined by the Timelock contract before attempting execution.

Here's a conceptual code snippet illustrating how you might implement alignment of timing parameters:

```solidity
function queue(uint256 proposalId) external {
    ...
    // Ensure eta is calculated based on the current timelock delay
    uint256 eta = block.timestamp + timelock.delay();
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
        _queueOrRevertInternal(
            proposal.targets[i],
            proposal.values[i],
            proposal.signatures[i],
            proposal.calldatas[i],
            eta
        );
    }
    ...
}

function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
    ...
    // Ensure the proposal is executed within the valid window
    require(
        block.timestamp >= proposals[proposalId].eta &&
        block.timestamp <= proposals[proposalId].eta + timelock.GRACE_PERIOD(),
        "GovernorBravoDelegate: Proposal outside of valid execution window"
    );
    ...
}
```
In this modification, the queue function calculates **eta** based on the current delay from the **Timelock** contract, and the execute function checks that the current timestamp is within the valid execution window defined by the **Timelock** contract before executing the proposal.
