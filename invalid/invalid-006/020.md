# Potential for Admin Role Abuse

## Summary
The **GovernorBravoDelegator** contract has an admin role with the ability to change the implementation contract. This centralizes a significant amount of power in the hands of the admin, potentially leading to abuse or mismanagement.
## Vulnerability Detail
The _setImplementation function allows the admin to change the contract to which calls are delegated. If the admin role is compromised or not governed properly, this could lead to the introduction of a malicious implementation, disrupting the governance process or leading to loss of funds.
## Impact
Improper or malicious use of the admin role to change the implementation contract can result in severe consequences, including loss of funds, disruption of the governance process, or other security breaches.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a multi-signature requirement or a governance process for critical admin actions such as changing the implementation contract. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure or abuse of the admin role. Consider using a multi-sig wallet or a DAO governance model to manage the admin role. Here's how you might adapt the **_setImplementation** function:

```solidity
// Require multiple confirmations for critical admin actions
function _setImplementation(address implementation_) public {
    require(isConfirmedAction(msg.sender, implementation_), "GovernorBravoDelegator::_setImplementation: confirmation required");
    require(
        implementation_ != address(0),
        "GovernorBravoDelegator::_setImplementation: invalid implementation address"
    );

    address oldImplementation = implementation;
    implementation = implementation_;

    resetActionConfirmation(implementation_);
    emit NewImplementation(oldImplementation, implementation);
}

// Function to register or confirm an action by a signer
function confirmAction(address action, address signer) public {
    require(isAdmin(signer), "GovernorBravoDelegator::confirmAction: only admin");
    // Logic to record confirmation
    ...
}

// Function to check if an action has been confirmed by required signers
function isConfirmedAction(address action) public view returns (bool) {
    // Logic to check confirmations
    ...
}

// Function to reset confirmations for an action
function resetActionConfirmation(address action) internal {
    // Logic to reset confirmations
    ...
}

// Function to check if an address is an admin
function isAdmin(address account) public view returns (bool) {
    // Logic to check if the account is an admin
    ...
}
```
