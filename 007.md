# Insufficient Guard Against Proposal ID Collision

## Summary
The propose function does not adequately guard against the possibility of proposal ID collision, potentially leading to proposal data being overwritten or mismanaged.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the propose function, the proposal ID is determined by incrementing the proposalCount. There is a check to ensure that the new proposal's ID does not already correspond to an existing proposal. However, this check may not be sufficiently robust to prevent all cases of proposal ID collision, especially if the proposal count reaches very large numbers or if there is unexpected behavior in the contract's state.
## Impact
A collision in proposal IDs can result in the overwriting of existing proposals or the creation of proposals with conflicting IDs, leading to confusion, mismanagement of proposals, or potential exploitation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the mechanism for generating and assigning proposal IDs to ensure uniqueness and prevent any possibility of collision. Consider using a more robust method for managing proposal IDs that does not solely rely on incrementing a counter. Additionally, implement comprehensive checks and fail-safes to handle any unexpected state or behavior that could lead to ID collision.
