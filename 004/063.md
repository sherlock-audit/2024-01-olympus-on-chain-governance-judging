# Signature Malleability Vulnerability in castVoteBySig

## Summary
Due to the inherent properties of ECDSA signatures used in Ethereum transactions, `castVoteBySig` function is vulnerable to a signature malleability issue

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function castVoteBySig(
    uint256 proposalId,
    uint8 support, // 0=against, 1=for, 2=abstain
    uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
) external {
    // ... existing code for domain separator and struct hash ...

    // Recovering the signatory from the signature
    address signatory = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);

    if (signatory == address(0)) revert GovernorBravo_InvalidSignature();
    
    // ... casting the vote ...
}
```
The `ecrecover` function used to derive the address from the signature does not account for this malleability. Therefore, two different signatures (having different 's' values) could lead to the same address being recovered. 

## Impact
If an attacker can malleably alter a signature without changing the recovered signatory address.
An attacker could exploit signature malleability to submit multiple votes using different variations of the same signature.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A more common way is to use the latest version of the OpenZeppelin ECDSA library.
