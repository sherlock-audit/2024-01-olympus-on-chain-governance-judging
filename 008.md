# Admin can set to zero address.

krkba
## Summary
There is lack of input validation in `constructor`.
## Vulnerability Detail
When there is no zero address validation in `timelock_` address , it can be set to zero and then in the line 37 the admin is set to `timelock_` which is zero address.
## Impact
Admin can set to zero address.
