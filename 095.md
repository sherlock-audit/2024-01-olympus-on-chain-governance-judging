# Missing Ether Return in GovernorBravoDelegate.execute()

## Summary

The [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L255) function in the [GovernorBravoDelegate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol) contract lacks a mechanism to return any remaining Ether to the caller after execution. This oversight may result in an unintended loss of Ether for users interacting with the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the **execute()** function, excess Ether sent to the contract is not returned to the caller, potentially leaving unused funds in the contract's balance.
```solidity 
    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
        if (state(proposalId) != ProposalState.Queued) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_NotQueued();

        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];

        // Check that proposer has not fallen below proposal threshold since proposal creation
        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can execute regardless of threshold
        if (
            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_BelowThreshold();

        proposal.executed = true;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                proposal.eta
            );
        }
        emit ProposalExecuted(proposalId);
    }
```
The Ether sent with the transaction should be returned to the caller if there is any remaining after the execution.

Example:
Suppose a user sends 1 Ether to the execute() function, and the execution of the proposal only requires 0.8 Ether. Currently, the remaining 0.2 Ether is not returned to the caller, resulting in an unintended loss of funds.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to financial losses for users who interact with the execute() function, as any excess Ether sent is not returned.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, modify the execute() function to include a check for remaining Ether and return it to the caller. An updated version could look like the following:

```solidity
  uint256 ethersUsed;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            ethersUsed += proposal.values[i];
            timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                proposal.eta
            );
        }

   uint256 remainingEth = msg.value <= ethersUsed ? 0 : msg.value - ethersUsed;

   if(remainingEth > 0) payable(msg.sender).call{value : remainingEth}("");
```
