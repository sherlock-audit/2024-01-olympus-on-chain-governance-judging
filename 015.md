# Potential for Execution of Outdated Proposals

## Summary
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract does not explicitly invalidate proposals after a certain period, potentially allowing outdated proposals to be executed if they meet the voting requirements at a much later time.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows for the creation, voting, and execution of governance proposals. However, there is no mechanism to automatically invalidate or expire proposals after a certain period. As a result, a proposal could technically remain in the system indefinitely and be executed at a later time if it reaches the required vote threshold, even if the context or state of the system has significantly changed since the proposal was created.
## Impact
The execution of outdated proposals can lead to actions that are no longer aligned with the current state or goals of the system. This could result in unintended consequences, including system misconfiguration, security vulnerabilities, or other operational risks.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to automatically invalidate or expire proposals after a certain period. This could involve adding an expiration timestamp to each proposal and checking this timestamp before allowing votes to be cast or the proposal to be executed. Here's a code snippet illustrating how you might implement proposal expiration:

```solidity
function state(uint256 proposalId) public view returns (ProposalState) {
    ...
    else if (proposal.expiration != 0 && block.timestamp > proposal.expiration) {
        return ProposalState.Expired;
    }
    ...
}

function propose(...) public returns (uint256) {
    ...
    newProposal.expiration = block.timestamp + PROPOSAL_LIFETIME;
    ...
}

function queue(uint256 proposalId) external {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Succeeded, "GovernorBravo_Queue_FailedProposal");
    require(block.timestamp < proposals[proposalId].expiration, "GovernorBravo_Queue_ProposalExpired");
    ...
}

function execute(uint256 proposalId) external payable {
    require(state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Queued, "GovernorBravo_Execute_NotQueued");
    require(block.timestamp < proposals[proposalId].expiration, "GovernorBravo_Execute_ProposalExpired");
    ...
}
```
In this modification, each proposal has an expiration timestamp, and the queue and execute functions check that the proposal has not expired before proceeding. This ensures that proposals cannot be queued or executed after they are no longer valid.
