# Missing zero address check for admin on Timelock constructor could break governance functionalities

## Summary
`Timelock.sol` would be useless if `address(0)` is assigned to `admin_` on constructor.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `address(0)` is mistakenly given to `admin_` parameter on contract's deploy, its ownership would be lost forever and `Timelock.sol` would be useless, since most of its functions are intended to be executed only by the admin.

## Impact
Core governance's functionalities such as: queueing, executing, canceling and vetoing proposals would always revert because `GovernorBravoDelegate` relies on Timelock functions to work properly and most of `Timelock.sol` functions are intended to be executed by the admin and in this case, the admin would the zero address and it would be impossible to recover contract's ownership.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for `address(0)` to `admin_` parameter on `Timelock.sol` constructor: 

_Timelock.sol_
```solidity
    constructor(address admin_, uint256 delay_) {
        if (delay_ < MINIMUM_DELAY || delay_ > MAXIMUM_DELAY) revert Timelock_InvalidDelay();

      // consider adding this check and a `Timelock_InvalidAdminAddress` custom error
      + if (admin_ == address(0)) revert Timelock_InvalidAdminAddress());

        admin = admin_;
        delay = delay_;
    }
```
