# Missing zero address check for admin on Timelock setFirstAdmin could break governance functionalities

## Summary
Timelock.sol would be useless if `address(0)` is assigned to admin_ on setFirstAdmin.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `address(0)` is mistakenly given to `admin_` parameter on contract's deploy, its ownership would be lost forever and Timelock.sol would be useless, since most of its functions are intended to be executed only by the admin.

## Impact
Core governance's functionalities such as: queueing, executing, canceling and vetoing proposals would always revert because `GovernorBravoDelegate` relies on Timelock functions to work properly and most of Timelock.sol functions are intended to be executed by the admin and in this case, the admin would be the zero address and it would be impossible to recover contract's ownership.

## Code Snippet
[Timelock::setFirstAdmin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/Timelock.sol#L72C1-L79C6)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check for address(0) to admin_ parameter on Timelock.sol setFirstAdmin:

_Timelock.sol_
```solidity
function setFirstAdmin(address admin_) public {
    // add check for address 0 on setFirstAdmin.
    + if (admin_ == address(0)) revert Timelock_InvalidAdminAddress());
      if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();
      if (initialized) revert Timelock_OnlyOnce();
      initialized = true;
      admin = admin_;

      emit NewAdmin(admin);
}
```

It would also be good practice to avoid calling this method `setFirstAdmin` alone and, instead, call it inside some initialization method (e.g., `GovernorBravoDelegate::initialize`) and bind it to `GovernorBravoDelegator`. This helps prevent forgetting to call it or calling it with the wrong parameters, as the admin of the `Timelock` should always be the GovernorBravoDelegator proxy.
