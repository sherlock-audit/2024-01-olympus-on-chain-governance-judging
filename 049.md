# The `castVoteInternal` function in the provided governance contract could potentially be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack

## Summary
A malicious contract could exploit the `castVoteInternal` functionâ€™s external calls to `getPriorVotes` , leading to a reentrancy attack.
## Vulnerability Detail

In the `castVoteInternal` function, there are external calls to the `getPriorVotes` function of the gohm contract. These calls occur before the state of the vote ( `receipt.hasVoted `) is updated. This ordering of operations exposes the function to a potential reentrancy attack.

 In this case, if the `getPriorVotes` function in the gohm contract is controlled by an attacker or is otherwise not secure, it could potentially call back into the `castVoteInternal` function before the first call is finished.

Below is a sequence of the reentrancy operations:

- The `castVoteInternal` function is called to cast a vote.
- The function makes an external call to `gohm.getPriorVotes.`
- Since the `receipt.hasVoted` state is not updated until after the `getPriorVotes` calls, the reentrant `castVoteInternal` call does not know that the voter has already voted. This allows the attacker to cast multiple votes in a single proposal.

## Impact

A successful reentrancy attack allows an attacker to cast multiple votes in a single proposal, altering the outcome of the vote. This disrupts the normal operation of the governance system and leads to loss of trust in the system.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this potential vulnerability, consider implementing a reentrancy guard in the `castVoteInternal` function
