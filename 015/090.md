# Re-entrancy through `_isHighRiskProposal` allows attacker to create multiple active proposals from one address

## Summary
 
Re-entrancy through `_isHighRiskProposal` allows attacker to create multiple active proposals from one EOA, even though they should only be able to use their voting power / whitelist status to create one active proposal at a time.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each proposer should only be allowed to have one proposal active at a time with their voting power, as observed in the following code in `propose` function:

```solidity
        uint256 latestProposalId = latestProposalIds[msg.sender];
        if (latestProposalId != 0) {
            ProposalState proposersLatestProposalState = state(latestProposalId);
            if (proposersLatestProposalState == ProposalState.Active)
                revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_AlreadyActive();
            if (proposersLatestProposalState == ProposalState.Pending)
                revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_AlreadyPending();
        }
```

However, in `_isHighRiskProposal`, the following code exists:

```solidity
                    if (action == 1) {
                        // Check if the module has a high risk keycode
                        if (isKeycodeHighRisk[Module(actionTarget).KEYCODE()]) return true;
                    }
```

There is no real check to see if `actionTarget`, which is a user provided address, is a real Olympus module, so this call could be to an arbitrary attacker controlled contract. The attacker controlled contract can then reenter and call `propose` once more. The above check on `latestProposalId` will be completely bypassed because the first call has not yet set the `latestProposalId`, so the attacker will be able to create multiple active proposals. 

## Impact

One address can create multiple active proposals.
