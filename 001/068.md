# Voting not possible due to incorrect usage of the getPriorVotes() function

## Summary

After proposing the proposal, users have three external functions available for voting. Each of them is using the internal `castVoteInternal()` function. This function implements [pessimistic vote casting mechanism](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/tree/main/bophades/audit/2024-01_governance#vote-casting). For pessimistic voting it attempts to compare result of two calls to the `getPriorVotes()` function (`IgOHM` interface). First call uses `proposal.startBlock` as input parameter, whereas second call uses `block.number`. On the testing environment, the second call works properly. However, on the production environment this function will always revert, as actual `gOHM` [implementation](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code)  does not accept `block.number` as input for `blockNumber` parameter.

## Vulnerability Detail

The pessimistic vote casting mechanism within the `castVoteInternal()` function is implemented as follows:

[GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L446](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L446)
```solidity
        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
        uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;
```

However, in current repository, unit tests implemented within the `GovernorBravoDelegate.t.sol` file are using mocked implementation `MockGohm` with such implementation:

[OlympusMocks.sol#L30](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/test/mocks/OlympusMocks.sol#L30)
```solidity
    function getPriorVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) public view returns (uint256) {
        return votes[account];
    }
``` 

By means of this mock, the vulnerability is not discoverable. 

The actual [implementation](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code)  of `gOHM`   is: 

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Determine the prior number of votes for an account as of a block number
     * @dev Block number must be a finalized block or else this function will revert to prevent misinformation.
     * @param account The address of the account to check
     * @param blockNumber The block number to get the vote balance at
     * @return The number of votes the account had as of the given block
     */
    function getPriorVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");
[...]
```

Thus, the current implementation of the `castVoteInternal()` function cannot work properly in the production environment as it always revert.

##  Proof of Concept

1. Within the `MockGohm` file add following line to the `getPriorVotes()` function and save the changes:
`require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");`
2. Run all unit tests within the `GovernorBravoDelegateTest.t.sol file` by means of the command:
`forge test --mc GovernorBravoDelegateTest`
3. Observe that above command finished with around half of tests as failed.

## Impact

With current implementation users will not be capable to vote for any proposal proposed.
Redeployment or an upgrade of solution will be required. Due to this fact, the usage of governance will be delayed.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use `block.number -1` instead of `block.number` for  the `getPriorVotes()` function within the `castVoteInternal()` function.
