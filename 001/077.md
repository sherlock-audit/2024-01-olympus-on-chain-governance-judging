# It's not possible to vote because the `GovernorBravoDelegate::castVoteInternal` function always fails

## Summary

The `GovernorBravoDelegate::castVoteInternal` function attempts to retrieve the user's votes at the time of voting. However, this always results in a revert, as such information can only be obtained about the previous or earlier block.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GovernorBravoDelegate::castVoteInternal` function utilizes the current `block.number` to retrieve user votes.

```solidity
uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
```

However, as we can observe in the [gOHM](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code) contract, such transactions will revert because this information has not yet been determined.

```solidity
require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");
```

## Impact

This issue causes a DoS on governor, preventing users from casting votes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
-    uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
+    uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number - 1);
```
