# Spam event `VoteCast` with call `castVote/castVoteWithReason` without votes

## Summary
`GovernorBravoDelegate#castVote()` and `GovernorBravoDelegate#castVoteWithReason()` can be called by anyone, even users that don't have any votes. Mystifier could use a large number of addresses to vote with zero votes to spam emitted event.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vulnerable code:
```solidity
    function castVoteInternal(
        address voter,
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint8 support
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        if (state(proposalId) != ProposalState.Active) revert GovernorBravo_Vote_Closed();
        if (support > 2) revert GovernorBravo_Vote_InvalidType();
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        Receipt storage receipt = proposal.receipts[voter];
        if (receipt.hasVoted) revert GovernorBravo_Vote_AlreadyCast();

        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
        uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

        if (support == 0) {
            proposal.againstVotes = proposal.againstVotes + votes;
        } else if (support == 1) {
            proposal.forVotes = proposal.forVotes + votes;
        } else if (support == 2) {
            proposal.abstainVotes = proposal.abstainVotes + votes;
        }

        receipt.hasVoted = true;
        receipt.support = support;
        receipt.votes = votes;

        return votes;
    }
```
Nowhere in the flow of voting does the function revert if the user calling it doesn't actually have any votes. The result is that any user can vote even if they don't have any votes, allowing users to spam event.

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The code should revert if `msg.sender` doesn't have any votes:

```diff
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
        uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

+        if (votes == 0) revert NoVotes();

        if (support == 0) {
            proposal.againstVotes = proposal.againstVotes + votes;
        } else if (support == 1) {
            proposal.forVotes = proposal.forVotes + votes;
        } else if (support == 2) {
            proposal.abstainVotes = proposal.abstainVotes + votes;
        }
```
