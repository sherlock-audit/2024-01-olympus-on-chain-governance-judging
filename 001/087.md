# Voting will revert because of incorrect use of getPriorVotes

## Summary

`getPriorVotes` is used incorrectly which will cause all voting actions to revert 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `castVoteInternal`, there is the following line of code:

`uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);`

However, if we look at the implementation of gohm on mainnet (https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code):

The first line of `getPriorVotes` is:

`require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");`

So the function `getPriorVotes` is not callable with the current block number, so `castVoteInternal` will always revert. This means users will be unable to vote. 

## Impact

Users cannot vote for proposals; their transactions will revert.

## Recommendation

Use `block.number - 1` instead of `block.number`
