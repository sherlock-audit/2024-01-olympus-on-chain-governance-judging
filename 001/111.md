# Voting functionality will always revert

## Summary

An integration issue exists in the `castVoteInternal` function, causing it to consistently revert, resulting in a Permanent Denial of Service (DoS) scenario for the voting functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the voting process, the `castVoteInternal` function undergoes three main steps:

1. `Validation Part`: Validates the nature of the vote.
2. `Vote Calculation Part`: Determines the minimum of current and original votes.
3. `Adding Votes Part`: Updates the state variables.

```solidity

    function castVoteInternal(
        address voter,
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint8 support
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // ---------SNIP: Validation ---------- //

        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
@->     uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

        // ---------SNIP: Adding Votes ---------- //

        return votes;
    }

```

The issue lies in the line marked with (@->), where `currentVotes` is calculated using the `block.number` parameter.

However, the [gOHM contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code) specifies a condition (line 703) that `block.number` must be less than the current block number to prevent misinformation (as per Natspec Line 697).

```solidity

      /**
        * @notice Determine the prior number of votes for an account as of a block number
697:    * @dev Block number must be a finalized block or else this function will revert to prevent misinformation.
        * @param account The address of the account to check
        * @param blockNumber The block number to get the vote balance at
        * @return The number of votes the account had as of the given block
      */
      function getPriorVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256) {
703:       require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");

           uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
           if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
               return 0;
           }

           // -------- SNIP ----------- //
       }

```

Because of this, `castVoteInternal` will always revert while calculating `currentVotes`.

## Impact

Integration error leading to Permanent DoS of voting mechanism.

## Recommendation

Update the code as follow:

```diff
      
    function castVoteInternal(
        address voter,
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint8 support
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // ---------SNIP: Validation ---------- //

        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
-       uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
+       uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number - 1);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

        // ---------SNIP: Adding Votes ---------- //

        return votes;
    }

```
