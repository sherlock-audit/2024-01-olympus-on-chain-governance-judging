# User unable to cast their votes due to revert `castVoteInternal`

## Summary
`castVoteInternal()` is an internal function that carries out voting logic. Users casting their votes for a proposal will always failed to do so because one of `getPriorVotes()` call will always revert due to incorrect parameter passed. 
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L433-L446

While casting votes, we always consider the minimum votes during `startblock` and `currentblock`. The issue is the calculation of votes for current block will always revert due to below check on gOHM token, https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code#L703

Instead of calculating the votes for last blocks, its calculating for `block.number`.

## Impact
Voting will be DoS, as its a core logic used at multiple places.

## Recommendation
Modify the currentVotes logic to below; 
```solidity
uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number - 1);
```
