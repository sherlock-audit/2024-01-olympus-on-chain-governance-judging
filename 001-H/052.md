# Users are unable to cast votes

## Summary
In the `castVoteInternal()` function, the parameter passed for retrieving user votes is `block.number`. However, within the `getPriorVotes()` function, there is a check `blockNumber < block.number`. This check causes validation to fail, preventing users from casting votes.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `GovernorBravoDelegate.castVoteInternal()` function carries out the voting logic. Within the function, the protocol calls `gohm.getPriorVotes()` to retrieve a user's votes at a specific block height. As shown in the code, when fetching the current votes for a user, the protocol invokes `getPriorVotes()` with the parameter `block.number`. 
```solidity
        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
        uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

```

However, inside the `getPriorVotes()` function, there is a check requiring `blockNumber < block.number`. This causes the function to fail the validation, preventing users from voting.
```solidity
    function getPriorVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256) {
        require(blockNumber < block.number, "gOHM::getPriorVotes: not yet determined");

        uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[account];
        if (nCheckpoints == 0) {
            return 0;
        }


```

## Impact
Users are unable to cast votes.

## Recommendation
Use `block.number-1` as the parameter to address this issue.
