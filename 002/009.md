# Risk of Unauthorized Proposal Cancellation

## Summary
The cancel function in the contract allows for the cancellation of proposals under certain conditions. However, the logic to determine who can cancel a proposal may not sufficiently prevent unauthorized or unintended cancellation in all cases.
## Vulnerability Detail
The cancel function permits the proposal's proposer to cancel it. Additionally, it allows the cancellation by other addresses if the proposer's vote count has dropped below the proposal threshold. While this logic is meant to prevent proposals from proceeding if the proposer no longer has significant backing, it might also enable scenarios where proposals can be canceled by actors other than the proposer under unexpected circumstances.
## Impact
If the cancellation logic is not tightly controlled, it might allow proposals to be canceled by parties other than the proposer, leading to potential disruption of the governance process and undermining the confidence of participants in the system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refine the logic surrounding who can cancel a proposal to ensure it aligns with the intended governance model. Ensure that the conditions under which a proposal can be canceled are explicit, well-documented, and aligned with the expectations of the community. Consider implementing additional checks or constraints to prevent unauthorized or unintended proposal cancellations.
