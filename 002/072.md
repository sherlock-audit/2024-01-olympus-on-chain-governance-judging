# A proposal created by a whitelisted user can still be cancelled by anyone if this user voting power fell below proposalThreshold

## Summary

A proposal created by a whitelisted user can still be cancelled by anyone if this user voting power fell below proposalThreshold.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Whitelisted users can create proposals even if their voting power is less than the proposalThreshold, usually these whitelisted users are from the protocol team to enable them from doing any vital upgrades or actions to the system.

- A proposal created by a whitelisted user is supposed to be cancelled by the proposer himself or by the `whitelistGuardian` **regardless** of the whitelisted proposer voting power at the time of cancellation.

- But it was noticed that anyone can cancel a proposal created by a whitelisted user if he doesn't have the minimum proposal threshold, and this contradicts with the `propose` function logic where whitelisted users can propose without having the minimum threshold.

## Impact

The whitelisted users act as a maintainers for the protocol where they can propose any vital upgrades to the protocol, and that's why they can propose without having the voting power that satisfies the prposalThreshold, and enabling anyone from cancelling their proposals will introduce risks to the system by preventing these upgrading proposals.

```javascript
if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) {
            // Whitelisted proposers can't be canceled for falling below proposal threshold
            if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer)) {
                if (
                    (gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                        proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
            } else {
                if (
                    gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                    proposal.proposalThreshold
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AboveThreshold();
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

Update `GovernorBravoDelegate.cancel` function to allow the `whitelistGuardian` only from cancelling the whitlisted proposer proposal regardless of the proposer voting power:

```diff
    function cancel(uint256 proposalId) external {
        if (state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Executed)
            revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AlreadyExecuted();

        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];

        // Proposer can cancel
        if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) {
            // Whitelisted proposers can't be canceled for falling below proposal threshold
            if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer)) {
-               if (
-                   (gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
-                       proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
-               ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();

+               if (msg.sender != whitelistGuardian)
+                revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
            } else {
                if (
                    gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                    proposal.proposalThreshold
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AboveThreshold();
            }
        }

     //the rest of the function...
    }
```
