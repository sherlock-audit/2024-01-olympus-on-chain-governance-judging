# `_isHighRiskProposal` lacks validation on some high risk operation.

## Summary

`_isHighRiskProposal` lacks validation on some high risk operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `propose` function, the following logic is used to determine whether an operation is high risk or not:

                    // If the action is upgrading a module (1)
                    if (action == 1) {
                        // Check if the module has a high risk keycode
                        if (isKeycodeHighRisk[Module(actionTarget).KEYCODE()]) return true;
                    }
                    // If the action is installing (2) or deactivating (3) a policy, pull the list of dependencies
                    else if (action == 2 || action == 3) {
                        // Call `configureDependencies` on the policy
                        Keycode[] memory dependencies = Policy(actionTarget)
                            .configureDependencies();

                        // Iterate over dependencies and looks for high risk keycodes
                        uint256 numDeps = dependencies.length;
                        for (uint256 j; j < numDeps; j++) {
                            Keycode dep = dependencies[j];
                            if (isKeycodeHighRisk[dep]) return true;
                        }
                    }

However, in [all functions](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-v3/blob/master/src/Kernel.sol#L17-L25) that can change the state of Kernel, There are some very important and dangerous operations that are not checked.

    /// @notice Actions to trigger state changes in the kernel. Passed by the executor
    enum Actions {
        InstallModule,
        UpgradeModule,
        ActivatePolicy,
        DeactivatePolicy,
        ChangeExecutor,
        MigrateKernel
    }

In the current code, `ChangeExecutor`(action == 4) and `MigrateKernel`(action == 5) are regarded as not-high risk operations and requires fewer votes to propose. But, since `ChangeExecutor` can change the governance contract address, `MigrateKernel` can merge the current Kernel into the new Kernel, they both have more dangerous inpacts than existing high-risk operations, so I think they should be considered as high risk.

## Impact

Proposer need less percentage of total supply in support of a proposal related to some high risk state change in the Default system required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Let `_isHighRiskProposal` return `true` when `action == 4 || action == 5`.
