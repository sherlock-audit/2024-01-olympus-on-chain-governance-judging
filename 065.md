# No Time Lock on Admin Transfer

## Summary

The acceptAdmin function in the Timelock contract allows the pendingAdmin to become the new admin without undergoing the timelock process, enabling instant transfer of control.

## Vulnerability Detail

The acceptAdmin function enables a pending admin to instantly assume the role of admin, bypassing the timelock mechanism. This design contradicts the principle of delayed execution, which is intended to provide stakeholders with visibility and time to react to administrative changes.

## Impact

The instant transfer of the admin role could be exploited in scenarios where rapid changes in administration are not expected or desired. Stakeholders might not have sufficient time to react to the change, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences in governance decisions or contract management.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/Timelock.sol#L93-#L99

```solidity
function acceptAdmin() public {
        if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin) revert Timelock_OnlyPendingAdmin();
        admin = msg.sender;
        pendingAdmin = address(0);

        emit NewAdmin(admin);
    }

    function setPendingAdmin(address pendingAdmin_) public {
        if (msg.sender != address(this)) revert Timelock_OnlyInternalCall();
        pendingAdmin = pendingAdmin_;

        emit NewPendingAdmin(pendingAdmin);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a time delay for admin transfers. Ensure transparency and involve the community in the admin transfer process, particularly given the context of the DAO.
