# Proposals cannot contain duplicate transactions

## Summary
Olympus makes use of Compound Governance Code, Features, Attributes. In an OpenZeppelin audit for [Compound Governance ](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit)there is a Medium finding to explicitly document behaviour of queing proposals in relation to verifying each action not being done already in this proposal or with the same eta. 

## Vulnerability Detail
"When queing a proposal in the Timelock contract, a check is done for each proposed action which verifies that this action is not being done already in this proposal or with the same eta. Although this design appears to be intentional, consider documenting this behavior explicitly."

## Impact
This will affect the maintanability, readability and usability of the code.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            _queueOrRevertInternal(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                eta
            );
        }

2. Manual Review

## Recommendation
See recommendation OpenZeppelin Audit Report M02-> https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit
"It must be made apparent to future development efforts that any functions which are intended to be called by governance can only be called once with the same parameters per proposal. Developers should understand to design functions such that multiple identical calls are unneeded."
