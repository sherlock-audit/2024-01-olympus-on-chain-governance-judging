# Lack of Emergency Response for Actions on External Contracts

## Summary
The GovernorBravoDelegate contract facilitates proposals that can interact with external contracts. While the admins of the protocols the contract integrates with are considered TRUSTED, there is no explicit mechanism to handle situations where these external contracts execute emergency actions (like pause or emergency withdrawal). This could potentially leave the governed protocol vulnerable if an integrated external contract behaves unexpectedly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Proposals in the GovernorBravoDelegate contract can contain actions targeting external contracts. In the absence of an on-chain emergency response mechanism, if one of these external contracts triggers an emergency action, it might lead to a scenario where the governance system cannot promptly mitigate potential threats or align with the new state of the external contract.
## Impact
Delayed or inadequate response to emergency situations in external contracts can result in significant risks, including loss of funds, reputational damage, or critical disruptions in the protocol's operations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce an emergency response mechanism in the GovernorBravoDelegate contract. This mechanism could include a function allowing a TRUSTED role (like the Veto Guardian or admin) to pause interactions with a specified external contract immediately upon detection of an emergency situation. Here's a proposed code snippet for implementing such a mechanism:

```solidity
// State variable to hold paused external contracts
mapping(address => bool) public pausedExternalContracts;

// Modifier to check if an external contract is paused
modifier whenNotPausedExternal(address _externalContract) {
    require(!pausedExternalContracts[_externalContract], "GovernorBravoDelegate: external contract is paused");
    _;
}

// Function to pause/unpause an external contract
function toggleExternalContractPause(address _externalContract) external {
    require(msg.sender == admin || msg.sender == vetoGuardian, "GovernorBravoDelegate: unauthorized");
    pausedExternalContracts[_externalContract] = !pausedExternalContracts[_externalContract];
    emit ExternalContractPauseToggled(_externalContract, pausedExternalContracts[_externalContract]);
}

// Updated queue function with the pause check
function queue(uint256 proposalId) external whenNotPausedExternal(proposal.targets[i]) {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
        _queueOrRevertInternal(
            proposal.targets[i],
            proposal.values[i],
            proposal.signatures[i],
            proposal.calldatas[i],
            eta
        );
    }
    ...
}

```
