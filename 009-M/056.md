# Missing codehash check in Timelock

## Summary
The [Timelock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/Timelock.sol) contract does not check the `codehash` for changes between proposal and execution.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code of an Ethereum address can change due to contract deployment and contract selfdestruct (plus potential re-initialization via `CREATE2`). This could lead to unforseen behaviour should the [Timelock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/Timelock.sol) contract not expect it. For example:
- Using `selfdestruct` in combination with `CREATE2`, the target contract could execute different logic when called than was expected.
- If the target address has no code, the [Timelock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/Timelock.sol) might execute a transaction that is expected to perform a simple ETH transfer to the target, however, unbeknownst to the proposer, the target is not an EOA, but instead a contract that had not been deployed on proposal creation, leading to the target receiving control flow during the call.

While an exploit involving this design requires a handful of pre-conditions to be fulfilled, it is a scenario that should be considered and should most likely be avoided. The timelocks of major protocols, most famously *MakerDAO*, implement protections against this by checking the `codehash` (see in the docs [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/pause-detailed-documentation#key-functionalities-as-defined-in-the-smart-contract) under `tag`, and in the code [here](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-pause/blob/0763eafcf926fd2e073aee5f047f3decb842231c/src/pause.sol#L97)).

## Impact
Potential for attacker gaining control flow during transaction execution or different logic being executed than was expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either:
- check that the `codehash` of the external contract has not changed between queuing and executing, or, even better
- pass the expected `codehash` as argument to the queuing method and check that is is unchanged when executing the transaction
