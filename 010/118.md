# Transaction queing is vulnerable to Replay Attacks

## Summary
The Timelock contract's transaction queuing mechanism is vulnerable to replay attacks, as it does not ensure the uniqueness of transaction hashes (txHash). If a transaction with the same parameters is queued again after being executed or cancelled, it will have the same txHash, potentially leading to unintended replay attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists in the queueTransaction function of the Timelock contract. It creates a transaction hash (txHash) based on the provided parameters. If a transaction with the same parameters is queued again, it will generate the same txHash, which could lead to unintended replay attacks.

```solidity
function queueTransaction(
    address target,
    uint256 value,
    string memory signature,
    bytes memory data,
    uint256 eta
) public returns (bytes32) {
    if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();
    if (eta < block.timestamp + delay) revert Timelock_InvalidExecutionTime();

    bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
    queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;

    emit QueueTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
    return txHash;
}
```


## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes:
1. Replay attacks, where old transactions are inadvertently executed or canceled.
2. Overwriting of transaction states, creating confusion and inconsistencies in the system's operation, potentially leading to governance issues.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability and ensure the uniqueness of transaction hashes, it is recommended to add a `nonce` to the `txHash` computation. The `nonce` ensures that each transaction is unique, even if all other parameters are the same. This modification mitigates the risk of replay attacks and unintended overwriting of transaction states.

Additionally, the code should check if a transaction with the same hash is already queued before allowing it to be queued again. Here's the modified code:

```solidity
function queueTransaction(
    address target,
    uint256 value,
    string memory signature,
    bytes memory data,
    uint256 eta
) public returns (bytes32) {
    if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();
    if (eta < block.timestamp + delay) revert Timelock_InvalidExecutionTime();

    // Add a nonce to ensure uniqueness of the txHash
    uint256 nonce = nonces[target][value][keccak256(bytes(signature))][keccak256(data)];
    bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta, nonce));

    // Check if transaction is already queued
    require(!queuedTransactions[txHash], "Transaction already queued");

    queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;
    nonces[target][value][keccak256(bytes(signature))][keccak256(data)] = nonce + 1;

    emit QueueTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
    return txHash;
}

// State variable for storing nonces
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => mapping(bytes32 => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)))) private nonces;
```

This modification ensures transaction uniqueness and prevents replay attacks by incorporating a `nonce` and checking if a transaction with the same hash is already queued.
