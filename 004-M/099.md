# `Timelock::setDelay` and `Timelock::setPendingAdmin` are highly sensitive but haven't been included in the high risk quorum requirements

## Summary

`Timelock::setDelay` and `Timelock::setPendingAdmin` are highly sensitive but haven't been included in the high risk quorum requirements 

## Vulnerability Detail

The two functions `Timelock::setDelay` and `Timelock::setPendingAdmin` can only be changed by the `Timelock` contract itself. This means a proposal would be required that goes through a voting process.

```solidity
    function setDelay(uint256 delay_) public {
        if (msg.sender != address(this)) revert Timelock_OnlyInternalCall();
        if (delay_ < MINIMUM_DELAY || delay_ > MAXIMUM_DELAY) revert Timelock_InvalidDelay();
        delay = delay_;


        emit NewDelay(delay);
    }
```

```solidity
    function setPendingAdmin(address pendingAdmin_) public {
        if (msg.sender != address(this)) revert Timelock_OnlyInternalCall();
        pendingAdmin = pendingAdmin_;


        emit NewPendingAdmin(pendingAdmin);
    }
```

The current implementation has been set up in a way to categorise high risk proposals and require higher quorum requirements. 

The two functions above qualify for consideration as high quorum proposals but currently would only require normal quorum.

## Impact

Changing the admin and the Timelock delay are highly sensitive actions. Normal quorum requirement for them makes it easier for malicious change or changes with unforseen consequences.
