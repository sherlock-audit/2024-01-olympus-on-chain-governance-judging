# Attacker has the ability to cause any proposal to fail with flashloan

## Summary
Attacker can change totalSupply of gohm with flashloan. Then frontrun the `propose` function makes `newProposal.quorumVotes` much higher and this cause proposal to fail in one transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
**Normal scenario:**
Total supply: 100
quorumVotes: 20 (or 30 for high risk)

**Attacked scenario:**
Total supply: 100
1. Normal proposer makes a transaction that propose a new proposal with `propose` function
2. Attacker takes a flashloan and buy gohm (Total supply: 500)
3. `propose` function executes with quorumVotes: 100 (or 150 for high risk)

In attacked scenario, the proposal will most probably fail.
## Impact
Attacker has the ability to cause any proposal to fail.

## Recommendation
Total supply should calculated with TWAP.
