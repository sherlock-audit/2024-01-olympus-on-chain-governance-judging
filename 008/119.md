# wrong implementation in execute and propose

## Summary
In the comment  it has been written that   " If proposer is whitelisted, they can queue regardless of threshold" and "        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can execute regardless of threshold" but we are implementing the whole check.
   if (
            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Queue_BelowThreshold();


## Vulnerability Detail

        // Check that proposer has not fallen below proposal threshold since proposal creation
        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can queue regardless of threshold

        if (
            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Queue_BelowThreshold();


  // Check that proposer has not fallen below proposal threshold since proposal creation
        // If proposer is whitelisted, they can execute regardless of threshold
        if (
            !isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer) &&
            gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Execute_BelowThreshold();

## Impact
not all thresold can be added.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use different if(Whitelisted(proposal.proposer) ) then allow else we should check the propose thresold.
