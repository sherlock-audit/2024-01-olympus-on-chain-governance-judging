# proposal execute state change

## Summary

here in execute function we are calling the  "timelock.executeTransaction"   if that call fails but our  proposal.executed = true has been assigned to true. due to this we cannot cancel this proposal  in cancel function.
   proposal.executed = true;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targets.length; i++) {
            timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.values[i]}(
                proposal.targets[i],
                proposal.values[i],
                proposal.signatures[i],
                proposal.calldatas[i],
                proposal.eta
            );

function cancel(uint256 proposalId) external {
        if (state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Executed)
            revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AlreadyExecuted();
