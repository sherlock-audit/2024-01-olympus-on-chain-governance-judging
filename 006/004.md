# Lack of Validation for Proposal Action Targets

## Summary
The propose function allows a proposal to include actions (targets, values, signatures, calldatas) without validating the legitimacy or safety of the target addresses. This could potentially allow proposals to include actions that interact with unsafe or unintended contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the propose function, while there are checks for proposal thresholds and the matching lengths of the proposal parameters, there is no check on the legitimacy or contract safety of the target addresses included in a proposal. Malicious actors could potentially craft proposals that target unsafe or malicious contracts, leading to unintended consequences when executed.
## Impact
If a proposal containing actions with unsafe target addresses is executed, it could lead to loss of funds, compromise of contract integrity, or other severe impacts on the contract and its stakeholders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a validation mechanism for the target addresses included in proposals. This could involve maintaining a list of approved contracts that are allowed to be interacted with through governance proposals. Additionally, consider implementing a review or validation process for adding new contracts to the approved list, ensuring that only safe and audited contracts can be targeted by governance actions.
