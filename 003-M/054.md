# The queue function can be front-run, causing normal users‘ proposals to be delayed to enter the queue.

## Summary

The queue function can be front-run, causing normal users to be unable to enter the queue.

## Vulnerability Detail

The action information in the queue is determined by target, value, signature, data and eta information, and the function `_queueOrRevertInternal` will reject the same information. So when a malicious user creates a proposal with the same action(only one is required), it can be front-run, causing the normal user's request to enter the queue to be rejected.

For example,

1. User A creates a proposal with 5 execution actions. Malicious user B creates 5 proposals, each containing an action from user A’s proposal.
2. These proposals passed the vote
3. When user A invokes the queue function, malicious user B front-runs. According to logic, normal user A will be front-run 5 times, causing user's proposal will be delayed in entering the queue.

## Impact

Proposals from normal users will be delayed in entering the queue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to distinguish different actions, other information can be added, such as the ID of the proposal.
