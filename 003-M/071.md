# Malicious actor can exploit `queuedTransactions` hash collisions to cancel others proposals

## Summary

Proposals with the same parameters (target,value, signature, calldatas, eta) will have the same `txHash` in the `Timelock`, which will result in hash collision that can be exploited by malicious users by creating similar proposals then cancelling them.

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract: whitelisted users and users with voting power greater than proposalThreshold can add proposals to be voted on, and when these proposals pass with `for` votes being greater than the quorum and greater than 55% of for + against votes; they will be queued in the `Timelock` contract where a hash is created by encoding the proposal`s target,value,signature,data and eta:

      ```javascript
              bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
              queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;
      ```

  knowing that eta is created when the transaction is queued:

        ```javascript
        uint256 eta = block.timestamp + timelock.delay()
        //....
        proposal.eta = eta;
        ```

  so as can be noticed; similar proposal parameters will result in creating the same hash by the timelock contract.

## Impact

**How could this be vulnerable to the system?**

- If there's a vital proposal that intends to upgrade/add/remove modules from/to the system:

  1. a malicious actor (that has enough voting power to propose) can observe the mem-pool and create the same proposal with the same parameters.
  2. then voting succeeds for the original and malicious proposals, then the original proposal is queued
  3. then the malicious actor calls `cancel` on his malicious proposal, where it will `cancelTransaction` in the timelock resulting in overriding the created txHash of the original proposal to be false as both the original and malicious proposals will have the same txHash:

     ```javascript
         function cancelTransaction(
             address target,
             uint256 value,
             string memory signature,
             bytes memory data,
             uint256 eta
         ) public {
             if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();

             bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
             queuedTransactions[txHash] = false;
     ```

  4. So the original proposal will not be executed as the `Timelock.executeTransaction` will revert because `queuedTransactions[txHash] == false`:

     ```javascript
         function executeTransaction(
             address target,
             uint256 value,
             string memory signature,
             bytes memory data,
             uint256 eta
         ) public payable returns (bytes memory) {
             if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();

             bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
             if (!queuedTransactions[txHash]) revert Timelock_InvalidTx_NotQueued();
     ```

  5. The same scenario can be considered if there's two proposals with similar parameters queued at the same time, and one of them is vetoed after being queued and the other is not; then the queued one can't be executed.

- So as can be noticed; creating the same hash for proposals with the same parameters is not prevented, which will result in maliciously or not maliciously cancelling/overriding queued transactions.

```javascript
        bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

Update `Timelock.queueTransaction` function to include the proposer address, this will ensure that hashes will not collide since each user can have one active proposal at a time:

```diff
function queueTransaction(
        address target,
        uint256 value,
        string memory signature,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 eta,
+       address proposer
    ) public returns (bytes32) {
        if (msg.sender != admin) revert Timelock_OnlyAdmin();
        if (eta < block.timestamp + delay) revert Timelock_InvalidExecutionTime();

-       bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta));
+       bytes32 txHash = keccak256(abi.encode(target, value, signature, data, eta, proposer));
        queuedTransactions[txHash] = true;

        emit QueueTransaction(txHash, target, value, signature, data, eta);
        return txHash;
    }
```
