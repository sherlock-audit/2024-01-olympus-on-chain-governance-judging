# Potential for Proposal Manipulation via Timing of Vote Counting

## Summary
The contract determines the outcome of proposals based on vote counts at specific block numbers. However, the timing of these vote counts can be manipulated due to the dynamic nature of the getPriorVotes function, potentially leading to discrepancies in the actual support for a proposal.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract uses the getPriorVotes function to fetch the number of votes that a voter had as of a given block number. This function is used to determine the voter's weight both at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Since votes can be delegated and undelegated, the actual number of votes during the voting period can differ significantly from the snapshot taken at the start of the proposal.
## Impact
If significant vote weight changes occur between the snapshot block and the time of voting, it could lead to a situation where the outcome of a proposal does not accurately reflect the current preference of the token holders. This can be exploited by manipulating vote timing, potentially affecting the integrity of the governance process.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a more robust mechanism for vote counting that accounts for the dynamic nature of vote delegation. One approach could be to lock in the voting weight of a voter for the duration of the proposal once they cast their vote, preventing further changes to their voting weight from affecting that particular proposal. Additionally, ensuring clear and transparent communication about how votes are counted and any potential limitations of the current system is crucial for maintaining trust in the governance process.
