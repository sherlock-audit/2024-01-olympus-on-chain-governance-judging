# GovernorBravoDelegate - Inadequate Handling of Proposal State Transitions

## Summary
The state transition logic for proposals in the state function does not account for all potential edge cases, particularly around the timing of vote casting and proposal execution. This could lead to proposals being stuck in an incorrect state or becoming executable at unexpected times.
## Vulnerability Detail
The state function determines the current state of a proposal based on block numbers and vote outcomes. However, the function's logic does not fully consider the timing of vote casting, proposal queuing, or execution. As a result, there might be scenarios where a proposal's state does not accurately reflect its true status in the governance process, potentially leading to confusion or manipulation.
## Impact
If the proposal state does not accurately reflect the actual status of the proposal, it could lead to proposals being stuck in a pending or active state indefinitely, or proposals becoming executable when they should not be. This can affect the integrity of the governance process and the correct implementation of community decisions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refine the logic in the state function to more accurately reflect the proposal lifecycle, including clear handling of the timing of vote casting, proposal queuing, and execution. Ensure that all edge cases are accounted for, and that the state of a proposal always accurately represents its actual status. Consider adding additional states or checks if necessary to cover all potential scenarios.
