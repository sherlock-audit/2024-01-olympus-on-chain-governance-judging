# Invariant Violation: Proposals to call `GovernorBravoDelegate#_setModuleRiskLevel` are not considered high-risk proposals.

## Summary

The function [`_isHighRiskProposal(address[],string[],bytes[])`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L611C5-L615C6) does not consider a proposal's attempt to deregister a module currently reserved as [`isKeycodeHighRisk`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L61C37-L61C54) as a high-risk action.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function [`_isHighRiskProposal(address[],string[],bytes[])`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L611C5-L615C6) is used to ensure potentially dangerous proposals require a higher level of quorum before being passed.

Since proposals are executed as an [`admin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/abstracts/GovernorBravoStorage.sol#L11) of [`GovernorBravoDelegate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol), it is possible for a proposal to modify which modules qualify as high risk via an `external` call to [`_setModuleRiskLevel(bytes5,bool)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L599C5-L602C6), but this is not considered a high-risk operation in itself.

> [!TIP]
> Consider the scenario of a standard-privilege user having the ability to control who has administrator rights in a system.

The result here is that a standard-quorum proposal can enable the execution of high-risk actions also at standard levels of quorum, which although in some scenarios may indeed be desirable, should first demand a higher-level of quorum in order to be sustained.

## Impact

Medium, as this is a direct subversion of access control to system-critical components due to an oversight in the permission system.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Sets whether a module is considered high risk
 * @dev Admin function to set whether a module in the Default Framework is considered high risk
 * @param module_ The module to set the risk of
 * @param isHighRisk_ If the module is high risk
 */
function _setModuleRiskLevel(bytes5 module_, bool isHighRisk_) external {
    if (msg.sender != admin) revert GovernorBravo_OnlyAdmin();
    isKeycodeHighRisk[toKeycode(module_)] = isHighRisk_;
}
```

## Tool used

Vim, Foundry

## Recommendation

Proposals attempting to target `address(this)` with calls to [`_setModuleRiskLevel(bytes5,bool)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L599C5-L602C6) should be considered a high risk operation when determining [`_isHighRiskProposal(address[],string[],bytes[])`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L611C5-L615C6).
