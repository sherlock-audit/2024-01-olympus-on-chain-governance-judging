# User A cannot cancel User B's proposal when User B's prior number of votes at relevant block is same as proposal threshold, which contradicts the fact that User B actually cannot create the proposal when the prior number of votes is same as proposal threshold

## Summary

Inconsistency of validation performed in `propose` and `cancel`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When User A calls the `propose` function for creating a proposal, it checks that User A's prior number of votes at the relevant block is larger than the proposal threshold through checking `gOHM.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) > getProposalThresholdVotes()`. This means that User A cannot create the proposal when the prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same.

    function propose(
        address[] memory targets,
        uint256[] memory values,
        string[] memory signatures,
        bytes[] memory calldatas,
        string memory description
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        // Allow addresses above proposal threshold and whitelisted addresses to propose
        if (
            gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) <= getProposalThresholdVotes() &&
            !isWhitelisted(msg.sender)
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_ThresholdNotMet();
        ...
    }

After User A's proposal is created, User B can call the `cancel` function to cancel it. When calling cancel, it checks that User A's prior number of votes at the relevant block is less than the proposal threshold through checking `gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >= proposal.proposalThreshold`. When User A's prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same, User B cannot cancel this proposal of User A. 

However, this contradicts the fact User A actually cannot create this proposal when the same condition holds true. In other words, if User A cannot create this proposal when the prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same, User B should be able to cancel User A's proposal under the same condition but it is not true. The functionality for canceling User A's proposal in this situation becomes unavailable for User B.

    function cancel(uint256 proposalId) external {
        if (state(proposalId) == ProposalState.Executed)
            revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AlreadyExecuted();

        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];

        // Proposer can cancel
        if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) {
            // Whitelisted proposers can't be canceled for falling below proposal threshold
            if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer)) {
                if (
                    (gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                        proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
            } else {
                if (
                    gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >=
                    proposal.proposalThreshold
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AboveThreshold();
            }
        }
    ...
    }

## Impact

User B should be able to cancel User A's proposal under the same condition but it is not true.

## Recommendation

Validation on [`propose`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L135-L138) can be changed to the following code.

        if (
            gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) < getProposalThresholdVotes() &&
            !isWhitelisted(msg.sender)
        ) revert GovernorBravo_Proposal_ThresholdNotMet();

Validation on [`cancel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/main/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L291-L304) can be changed to the following code.

        if (msg.sender != proposal.proposer) {
            // Whitelisted proposers can't be canceled for falling below proposal threshold
            if (isWhitelisted(proposal.proposer)) {
                if (
                    (gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >
                        proposal.proposalThreshold) || msg.sender != whitelistGuardian
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_WhitelistedProposer();
            } else {
                if (
                    gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) >
                    proposal.proposalThreshold
                ) revert GovernorBravo_Cancel_AboveThreshold();
            }
        }

but not both.
