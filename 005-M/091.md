# Incorrect usages of greater than or equal to vs greater than across the codebase

## Summary

There are a few parts of the code where `<=` is used in one function but `<` is used in another for the same check. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `propose`, we check:

`gohm.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) <= getProposalThresholdVotes()`

and revert if so

But in `queue` we check:

`gohm.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold`

and revert if so 

So if the number of prior votes is exactly the proposal threshold, we should be able to propose but aren't able to. 

2. In `state`, we have:
```solidity

else if (block.timestamp >= proposal.eta + timelock.GRACE_PERIOD()) {
            return ProposalState.Expired;
        }
```

So the proposal will be expired if `block.timestamp >= proposal.eta + timelock.GRACE_PERIOD()`. However, in `executeTransaction` in `Timelock.sol`, we have:

`if (block.timestamp > eta + GRACE_PERIOD) revert Timelock_InvalidTx_Stale();`

So if `block.timestamp =  proposal.eta + timelock.GRACE_PERIOD()`, `execute` in `GovernorBravoDelegate` will prevent us from executing since `state` will return Expired even though we should be able to. 


## Impact
Discrepancies can lead to inability to propose or execute
