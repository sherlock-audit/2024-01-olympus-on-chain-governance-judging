# `proposal.quorumVotes` doesn't reflect the actual quorum at the time of voting

## Summary

Ceated proposals will be assigned a quorumVotes of 20% of the totalSupply of the gOHM tokens at the time of proposal creation, while it considers the voting power of the voters at the `proposal.startBlock`, where the 20% of the totalSupply will be larger, resulting in reaching quorumVotes faster.

## Vulnerability Detail

- When a proposal is created, the quorumVotes assigned to that proposal is calculated based on 20% of the totalSupply of the gOHM tokens at that time.

- When gOHM holders vote on a proposal: the current voting mechanism implemented by the protocol depends on considering the minimum voting power of a voter between the power at the startBlock of the proposal and the power at the current `block.number`:

      ```javascript
              uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
              uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
              uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;
      ```

  knowing that the startBlock is assigned to the proposal upon creation, where it counts 3-7 days (`votingDelay`) from the proposal creation until the voting starts.

- So as can be noticed; the voting power of the voter at the `proposal.startBlock` is considered while it should be at the time the proposal created, as the `proposal.quorumVotes` is calculated based on the totalSupply at the time of proposal creation, so the voting power should be considered from the time of proposal creation not at the `proposal.startBlock`.

## Impact

Considering the voting power at the `proposal.startBlock` instead of considering it at the time of proposal creation will result in reaching `proposal.quorumVotes` faster, as the assigned `proposal.quorumVotes` will be lower than intended.

```javascript
    function getQuorumVotes() public view returns (uint256) {
        return (gohm.totalSupply() * quorumPct) / 100_000;
    }
```

[GovernorBravoDelegate.castVoteInternal function /L444-L447](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-olympus-on-chain-governance/blob/6171681cfeec8a24b0449f988b75908b5e640a35/bophades/src/external/governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L444L447)

```javascript
        // Get the user's votes at the start of the proposal and at the time of voting. Take the minimum.
        uint256 originalVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, proposal.startBlock);
        uint256 currentVotes = gohm.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);
        uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

Update `castVoteInternal` function to consider voting power at the time of proposal creation instead of taking it at `proposal.startBlock`.
